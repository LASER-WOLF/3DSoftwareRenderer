		- Added function to find barycentric coordinates for a point on a triangle
		- Added swap.h & swap.c (with functions for swapping ints and floats)
		- Added new render mode (textured triangle)
		- Added uv texture coords to triangles and faces
		- Added tex2_t
		- Added texture.h & texture.c
	# Eleventh:
		(Projection matrix & Light and shading)
		- Added flat shading lighting to rendering
		- Added light.h and light.c with global light type and light intensity function
